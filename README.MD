# Rememory

Rememory is a simple, responsive, full stack app built in TypeScript using React on the front-end, and Node and MongoDB on the back-end. User Authentication is enabled by JWT custom auth and Google OAuth.

The client is deployed on Github Pages and the server API is deployed on Heroku.

The app allows an authenticated user to add new, edit and delete card posts of their favorite nostalgic recollections - a vacation, a sports game, a dinner etc. as well as like posts made by others in the community.
